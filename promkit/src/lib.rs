//!
//! [![ci](https://github.com/ynqa/promkit/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/ynqa/promkit/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
//! [![docs.rs](https://img.shields.io/docsrs/promkit)](https://docs.rs/promkit)
//!
//! A toolkit for building your own interactive prompt in Rust.
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! Put the package in your `Cargo.toml`.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! promkit = "0.8.0"
//! ```
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - Support cross-platform both UNIX and Windows owing to [crossterm](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm)
//! - Various building methods
//!   - Preset; Support for quickly setting up a UI by providing simple parameters.
//!     - [Readline](https://github.com/ynqa/promkit/tree/v0.8.0#readline)
//!     - [Confirm](https://github.com/ynqa/promkit/tree/v0.8.0#confirm)
//!     - [Password](https://github.com/ynqa/promkit/tree/v0.8.0#password)
//!     - [Select](https://github.com/ynqa/promkit/tree/v0.8.0#select)
//!     - [QuerySelect](https://github.com/ynqa/promkit/tree/v0.8.0#queryselect)
//!     - [Checkbox](https://github.com/ynqa/promkit/tree/v0.8.0#checkbox)
//!     - [Tree](https://github.com/ynqa/promkit/tree/v0.8.0#tree)
//!   - Combining various UI components.
//!     - They are provided with the same interface, allowing users to choose and
//!       assemble them according to their preferences.
//!   - (Upcoming) Stronger support to display yor own data structures.
//! - Versatile customization capabilities
//!   - Theme for designing the appearance of the prompt.
//!     - e.g. cursor, text
//!   - Validation for user input and error message construction.
//! - Mouse support (partially)
//!   - Allows scrolling through lists with the mouse wheel
//!
//! ## Examples/Demos
//!
//! See [here](https://github.com/ynqa/promkit/tree/v0.8.0#examplesdemos)
//!
//! ## Why *promkit*?
//!
//! Related libraries in this category include the following:
//! - [console-rs/dialoguer](https://github.com/console-rs/dialoguer)
//! - [mikaelmello/inquire](https://github.com/mikaelmello/inquire/tree/main/inquire)
//!
//! *promkit* offers several advantages over these libraries:
//!
//! ### Unified interface approach for UI components
//!
//! *promkit* takes a unified approach by having all of its components inherit the
//! same `Renderer` trait. This design choice enables users to seamlessly support
//! their custom data structures for display, similar to the relationships seen in
//! TUI projects like [ratatui-org/ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui)
//! and
//! [EdJoPaTo/tui-rs-tree-widget](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/tui-rs-tree-widget).
//! In other words, it's straightforward for anyone to display their own data
//! structures using widgets within promkit.  
//! In contrast, other libraries tend to treat each prompt as a mostly independent
//! entity. If you want to display a new data structure, you often have to build the
//! UI from scratch, which can be a time-consuming and less flexible process.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! pub trait Renderer: AsAny + Finalizer {
//!     /// Creates a collection of panes based on the specified width.
//!     ///
//!     /// This method is responsible for generating the layout of the UI components
//!     /// that will be displayed in the prompt. The width parameter allows the layout
//!     /// to adapt to the current terminal width.
//!     ///
//!     /// # Parameters
//!     ///
//!     /// * `width`: The width of the terminal in characters.
//!     ///
//!     /// # Returns
//!     ///
//!     /// Returns a vector of `Pane` objects that represent the layout of the UI components.
//!     fn create_panes(&self, width: u16) -> Vec<Pane>;
//!
//!     /// Evaluates an event and determines the next action for the prompt.
//!     ///
//!     /// This method is called whenever an event occurs (e.g., user input). It allows
//!     /// the renderer to react to the event and decide whether the prompt should continue
//!     /// running or quit.
//!     ///
//!     /// # Parameters
//!     ///
//!     /// * `event`: A reference to the event that occurred.
//!     ///
//!     /// # Returns
//!     ///
//!     /// Returns a `Result` containing a `PromptSignal`. `PromptSignal::Continue` indicates
//!     /// that the prompt should continue running, while `PromptSignal::Quit` indicates that
//!     /// the prompt should terminate its execution.
//!     fn evaluate(&mut self, event: &Event) -> anyhow::Result<PromptSignal>;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Variety of Pre-built UI Preset Components
//!
//! One of the compelling reasons to choose *promkit* is its extensive range of pre-built UI preset components.
//! These presets allow developers to quickly implement various interactive prompts without the need to design and
//! build each component from scratch. The availability of these presets not only speeds up the development process
//! but also ensures consistency and reliability across different applications.
//! Here are some of the preset components available, see [Examples](#examplesdemos)
//!
//! ### Resilience to terminal resizing
//!
//! Performing operations that involve executing a command in one pane while
//! simultaneously opening a new pane is a common occurrence. During such operations,
//! if UI corruption is caused by resizing the terminal size, it may adversely affect
//! the user experience.  
//! Other libraries can struggle when the terminal is resized, making typing and
//! interaction difficult or impossible. For example:
//!
//!  - [(console-rs/dialoguer) Automatic re-render on terminal window resize](https://github.com/console-rs/dialoguer/issues/178)
//!
//! *promkit* introduces a step to align data with the screen size before rendering.
//! This approach ensures consistency in UI elements even when
//! the terminal size changes, providing a smoother user experience.
